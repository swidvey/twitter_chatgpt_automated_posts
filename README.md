In this notebook, we explored how to use the OpenAI API to generate text using the ChatGPT model, and how to use the Twitter API to post the generated text to a Twitter account. We began by setting up our OpenAI API key and installing the openai library. We then created a simple Python script to send a prompt to the ChatGPT model and receive a response. 
Next, we set up our Twitter API keys and installed the tweepy library. We created a new Twitter app and obtained our consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and access token secret. We then wrote a Python script to authenticate with the Twitter API and post the generated text to our Twitter account.<br>
Finally, we were able to successfully integrate the OpenAI and Twitter APIs by combining the two scripts to generate text using ChatGPT and post the results to Twitter. We also emphasized the importance of adhering to best practices when using these APIs, such as complying with their terms of service and protecting private information.<br>



Projected Stopped with twitter (X)'s yearly charges they are planning for with tweets/retweets. $1 a year is just not worth gving X for this project.
